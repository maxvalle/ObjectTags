# ObjectTags
A simple Xojo module to implement an Object.ObjectTag property.

Any object in Xojo is a subclass of Object, hence, with this module, every object gets a new property:

Object.ObjectTag As Variant

where to store anything.

Note: this module was inspired and suggested by Charles Yeomans. Thanks.
